## What is NFThief?
NFTthief is an offensive tool that allows users to automate the process of 'stealing' the IPFS-based NFT collections from OpenSea mainnet or testnet as well as uploading and minting the 'stolen' NFT collections with the help of ERC-721 smart contract. It is created to prove that multiple NFT marketplaces including OpenSea, Rarible, NFTrade, and LooksRare, failed to identify fradulent NFTs. 

## How to setup and run?
Refer to [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/rainyraina/2206_NFThief/wiki/Step-by-step-tutorial) on how to setup and run the program.
